# life-expectancy-GDP-analysis
Exploring the potential link between life expectancy and GDP across countries through data analysis.

Welcome to the "Life Expectancy vs. GDP Analysis" repository. This project aims to investigate the potential correlation between a country's economic output, as measured by its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the life expectancy of its citizens. Through comprehensive data analysis, visualization, and statistical techniques, we delve into understanding whether there exists a strong relationship between these two vital indicators.

Key Objectives:

Collect and curate data on GDP and life expectancy from various countries.
Explore and clean the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.
Utilize statistical methods to quantify the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
Generate insightful visualizations to illustrate potential trends and patterns.
Discuss findings, limitations, and implications for public policy and further research.
This repository serves as a hub for our project's code, data sources, analysis notebooks, and visual outputs. By openly sharing our research process and results, we aim to contribute to the broader understanding of the factors influencing life expectancy and encourage discussions around socioeconomic impact on public health.

Feel free to explore my work, contribute your insights, or use my code as a reference for your own analyses. Your feedback and collaboration are highly appreciated as we collectively strive to unravel the intricate relationship between economic prosperity and the well-being of populations.
